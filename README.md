## My Powershell Playground

This repo represents my progress of learning the Powershell based
on the excercises from the [book](https://https://livebook.manning.com/book/learn-powershell-in-a-month-of-lunches/) I own.


**Notes**

Getting help:
- The Help keyword is a function, which is a wrapper around the core Get-Help cmdlet. Ex:
```
    Help *event*
    Help *object*
```
  - Parameter sets
  - Common parameters [<CommonParameters>]
  - Optional and mandatory parameters
  - Positional parameters
